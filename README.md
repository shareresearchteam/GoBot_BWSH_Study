# GoBot and BWSH Study Supplementary Materials
Video attachment is a compilation of study clips demonstrating differences in interactions for both participants (P1 and P2) in the study when comparing session 1 (initial) and session 12 (final).

Additional figures display survey ratings for the 3 components of the #Negative Attitudes towards Robots Scale (NARS)# (Syrdal et al. 2009) survey and the #Trust Perception Scale-HRI 14-item subscale (TPS-HRI)# (Schaefer 2016). These surveys were filled out by parents of both participants to understand their perceptions and trust levels of a robot being used as a component of their child's clinical care, but also to potentially use the same robot in the parents' homes.

Responses to the NARS survey are rated on a 7-pt Likert scale where a decrease in ratings for each component would indicate that the parent tended towards a lower negative attitude towards robots for that component. Responses to the TPS-HRI survey are rated on a percentage scale from 0 to 100 where higher values indicate that the parent tended towards trusting the robot more.

#### P2 NARS Ratings

#### P1 and P2 Trust Ratings
![Trust Ratings P1 and P2](trust_results.png?raw=true)
TPS-HRI survey results showing the mean and standard deviation of parent responses for both P1 and P2 to the 14-item subscale indicating their trust in the robot used for this study. The survey was administered to parents at the beginning and end of the study.
